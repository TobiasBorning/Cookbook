# __Cookbook__

## _Group 2322, IT1901_
---
This is group 22's IT1901 project. We have made a cookbook app that helps people store and organize their recipes. More info about the cookbook project [here](/cookbook-project/readme.md)

## _How to run the app_
---
```bash
# navigate to the cookbook-project directory:
% cd cookbook-project

# maven install:
% mvn clean install -DskipTests

# navigate to the ui directory:
% cd ui

# run the app
% mvn javafx:run
```

## _Project structure_
---
The the project has two modules; core and ui. The core module contains the business logic and the ui module contains the user interface. The ui module handles the user interface and interaction. The project is built using maven.
