# __Cookbook__

## _Project description_

The Cookbook is an application containing recipes, along with the ingredients needed for each respective recipe. The app will provide inspiration concerning what meals to make. On the app's homepage, the user can scroll through the list of recipes. When clicking the recipes, you get a more detailed description on how to make the dish.

As we progress through the iterations, we will further develop the app to allow users to filter recipes based on different cuisines, such as Italian og Mexican. Additionally, users will also be able to search for desired recipes.

In addition to this, users will be able to add and remove recipes from the cookbook.
