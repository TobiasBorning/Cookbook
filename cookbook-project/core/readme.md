# Core module

The core module is responsible for the logic of the cookbook app. It contains the [Cookbook](/cookbook-project/core/src/main/java/cookbook/core/Cookbook.java) and [Recipe](/cookbook-project/core/src/main/java/cookbook/core/Recipe.java) classes, which is responsible for the internal representation of the cookbook. The module also contains the class [CookbookHandler](/cookbook-project/core/src/main/java/cookbook/json/CookbookHandler.java), responsible for reading and writing to json.

The module also contains tests for all the classes, located inside the [test](/cookbook-project/core/src/test/) folder.
