# Documentation for release 1

In release 1 we have focused on implementing the primary functionality of the application, making it useful for its purpose as a cookbook. It can now handle the primitive task of showing different recipes, along with the belonging ingredients. The recipes will be stored in a json-file, providing insurance that the data will not be lost if the application is closed.
