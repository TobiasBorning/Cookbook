## Release 2

The second release extends the first release with new and refined changes to the Cookbook-app functionality. At the main scene we have made it possible to search for a specific recipe and filter by origin. We have also made a view button and remove button to all of the recipes. When the remove button of a recipe is being pressed the recipe will be removed from the cookbook and the json-file. When the user presses a view button, the scene changes to an overview of the belonging ingredients and description, to the belonging recipe. We have also added the functionality of adding new recipes when the user presses the button “add new recipe”. Then the scene will switch to the add recipe scene, where the user can write in recipe name, origin, description and decide what ingredients the recipe should contain, along with the amount of each ingredient. When the recipe gets added, the new recipe will be added to the cookbook and the json file. We have also implemented a “back” button for the add recipe scene, if the user just wants to return to the main scene. The new functionalities satisfy the user stories given in this release.
